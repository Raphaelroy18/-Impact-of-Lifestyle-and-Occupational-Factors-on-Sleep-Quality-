# Impact of Lifestyle and Occupational Factors on Sleep Quality

*This project analysis how lifestyle, stress, and occupation affect sleep quality using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. It reveals how physical activity, work habits, and health indicators influence rest, promoting data-driven wellness and healthier living patterns*.

**Introduction**

Sleep is one of the most essential physiological activities required for healthy living, yet in modern society, it is often neglected due to increased work demands, technology use, and lifestyle stress. Poor sleep has been linked to reduced productivity, mental fatigue, obesity, stress, and cardiovascular risks.
In today’s fast-paced world where remote work, multitasking, and long hours are common understanding how lifestyle factors such as occupation, stress, physical activity, and BMI affect sleep is crucial. This project analysis how these factors interact and influence sleep quality and sleep duration, using real-world data and data visualization techniques.


**Project Overview**

This project, explores how demographic, occupational, and lifestyle factors correlate with sleep health among working adults.
Using Power BI and Python analytics, the study investigates the relationships between:
•	Occupation and sleep quality,
•	Physical activity (daily steps) and sleep duration,
•	Stress level, heart rate, and BMI as lifestyle indicators.
The dashboard visually presents these patterns, making it easier to interpret data-driven insights that support recommendations for improving health and wellness in professional and personal life.


**Dataset Overview**

The dataset, titled contains records of individuals demographic details, sleep behaviour, and lifestyle indicators. Each column represents a specific factor influencing rest and health.
Feature	Description
Gender	Male or Female participants
Age	Participant age in years
Occupation	Profession or job type (e.g., Nurse, Engineer, Doctor, etc.)
Sleep Duration (hours)	Average sleep per night
Quality of Sleep (scale 1–10)	Self-assessed measure of sleep quality
Stress Level (scale 1–10)	Self-assessed daily stress intensity
Physical Activity Level	Daily activity intensity
BMI Category	Body Mass Index (Normal, Overweight, Obese)
Heart Rate (bpm)	Average resting heart rate
Daily Steps	Number of steps per day
The dataset provides a well-rounded view of how lifestyle, occupation, and health interact allowing for meaningful analysis of real-life sleep patterns.

The dataset used in this project was sourced from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

**Project Objective**

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

1.	To analyse the relationship between lifestyle factors (stress, BMI, daily activity) and sleep quality.
2.	To understand occupational effects on rest patterns among different job categories.
3.	To determine gender distribution and ensure balanced data representation.
4.	To visualize correlations between physical activity (steps taken) and sleep duration.
5.	To provide recommendations for improving lifestyle and sleep health among working adults.

**Why This Particular Analysis?**

Sleep directly influences productivity, decision-making, emotional stability, and physical health. However, modern lifestyles often compromise rest due to long work hours, high stress, sedentary habits, and irregular routines.
This analysis is important because:
•	It quantifies the impact of lifestyle and occupational stress on sleep health.
•	It helps employers and health practitioners identify areas for wellness interventions.
•	It provides data-driven evidence that sleep quality improves with balanced activity and stress management.
•	It supports public health initiatives promoting physical activity and work-life balance.
In essence, this project bridges data analytics and health awareness, showing how smart data use can lead to healthier communities.

**Importance of This Research** 

This research is important because it helps to understand how lifestyle, work patterns, and health behaviours influence sleep quality, which is a critical component of human health and productivity. In recent years, the rise of technology-driven jobs, longer screen time, and increased workplace stress have made poor sleep a public health concern.
Using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset allows us to explore these relationships quantitatively — identifying patterns and predictors that can inform health interventions, workplace policies, and personal lifestyle changes.

Specifically, this research is important because it:
1.	Identifies Key Determinants of Sleep Quality
The dataset includes factors such as age, stress level, physical activity, daily steps, and heart rate. Analysing them helps reveal which variables most strongly affect how well people sleep.
2.	Connects Modern Work Habits to Sleep Health
Occupation and activity level data provide insights into how different job types (e.g., office-based vs. physically active) influence sleep patterns, stress, and health outcomes.
3.	Supports Evidence-Based Wellness Decisions
The findings can guide healthcare practitioners, organizations, and individuals in making informed choices about exercise, stress management, and work–life balance.
4.	Promotes Mental and Physical Health Awareness
Sleep quality is linked to memory, focus, metabolism, and immunity. Understanding its relationship with lifestyle factors emphasizes the need for good sleep hygiene in everyday living.
5.	Contributes to Research on Preventive Health
Early identification of poor sleep habits and associated risk factors (like high stress or low activity) can help prevent chronic diseases and improve long-term well-being.

**Tools and Technologies Used**

Tool / Technology	Purpose

**Key Insights from the Dashboard**

1.	Average Sleep Duration: 7.13 hours — aligns with recommended sleep length.
   
2.	Average Sleep Quality: 7.31 / 10 — moderate to good quality among most individuals.

3.	Occupation Impact: Nurses, engineers, and doctors show higher sleep quality than managers and sales roles.
   
4.	Gender Distribution: Balanced dataset (50% male, 50% female).
   
5.	BMI Relation: Individuals with normal BMI report better sleep quality.
   
6.	Physical Activity Influence: Moderate daily steps (6K–8K) associate with longer sleep duration.


**Summary**

The analysis reveals that:

•	Occupation type significantly affects sleep quality due to varying work demands.

•	BMI and physical activity show strong correlations with better sleep outcomes.

•	Stress management remains a key factor in ensuring healthy rest.

These findings confirm that sleep is not only a biological need but also a lifestyle outcome influenced by occupational and personal habits.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how data analytics can uncover valuable insights about human wellbeing. By analysing lifestyle data, we learn that achieving optimal sleep requires balancing workload, physical activity, and stress management.
In modern jobs, where burnout and fatigue are common, such analysis can guide both individuals and organizations to adopt healthier routines, improve productivity, and enhance quality of life.
Ultimately, sleep health should be seen not as a luxury, but as a measurable and improvable aspect of modern living.
