# Impact of Lifestyle and Occupational Factors on Sleep Quality
This project analysis how lifestyle, stress, and occupation affect sleep quality using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. It reveals how physical activity, work habits, and health indicators influence rest, promoting data-driven wellness and healthier living patterns.

Introduction
Sleep is one of the most essential physiological activities required for healthy living, yet in modern society, it is often neglected due to increased work demands, technology use, and lifestyle stress. Poor sleep has been linked to reduced productivity, mental fatigue, obesity, stress, and cardiovascular risks.
In today’s fast-paced world where remote work, multitasking, and long hours are common understanding how lifestyle factors such as occupation, stress, physical activity, and BMI affect sleep is crucial. This project analysis how these factors interact and influence sleep quality and sleep duration, using real-world data and data visualization techniques.


Project Overview
This project, titled “Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle Analysis,” explores how demographic, occupational, and lifestyle factors correlate with sleep health among working adults.
Using Power BI and Python analytics, the study investigates the relationships between:
•	Occupation and sleep quality,
•	Physical activity (daily steps) and sleep duration,
•	Stress level, heart rate, and BMI as lifestyle indicators.
The dashboard visually presents these patterns, making it easier to interpret data-driven insights that support recommendations for improving health and wellness in professional and personal life.
